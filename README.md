# OOP-Based Systems Repository

Welcome to the OOP-Based Systems repository. This repository contains multiple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based systems, including Parking Management System, Railway Ticket Reservation, Employee Management, Taxi Booking, and Bus Ticket Booking. Each system is designed to demonstrate the principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
